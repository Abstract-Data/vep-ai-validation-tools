**Installation Problems**

If you encounter issues during installation, try:

1. Update pip: ``pip install --upgrade pip``
2. Use a virtual environment
3. Check Python version compatibility (>=3.8.1)

**Build Issues**

For build-related problems:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: ``uv sync``
2. Clear cache: ``uv cache clean``
3. Check for conflicting packages
