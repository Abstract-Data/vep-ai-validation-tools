**PROCESSING RULES:**

1. Extract election type from field name and/or value
2. Extract year from field name or value
3. Determine participation from value
4. Identify voting method if specified
5. Infer jurisdiction from context
6. Handle ambiguous cases (like "GR") based on context
7. Set confidence based on clarity of parsing
8. Flag unclear patterns as parsing errors

Parse all election-related fields and return structured results.
